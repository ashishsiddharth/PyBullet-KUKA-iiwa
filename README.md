# PyBullet-KUKA-iiwa
KUKA iiwa Robot Simulation with PyBullet

Notes
Ensure you have PyBullet and NumPy installed to run this code.
This project uses PyBullet for physics simulation and URDF models for the robot and environment objects.
The simulation is set to real-time mode, so you can interact with the robot and objects dynamically.
You can optionally log joint states by enabling the storeData function.
